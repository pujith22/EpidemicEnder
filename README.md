__Motive__

We can never expect when we must face an epidemic. And donâ€™t know if we are ready to face one all the time. It takes years to find the right cure for any novel viruses (around 3 years). In this case, social distancing is the only way to eradicate the virus only with the help of our immunity.
Using technology, we can pin-pointedly identify new cases, which would help the modelling in a better way. And also helps in keeping the medical records pin-pointedly for better analysis.

__Objectives:__

1. To build an integrated application where users can see all the updates, see
necessary resources for ending the current epidemic as well as handling future
epidemics.
2. Identify any new cases in current as well as future epidemics and alert the people around the surroundings to be careful. In this way, we can stop the epidemics at the start stage itself.
3. Using the data, help governments to identify potential hot-spot areas and
propose lock-downs to be initiated to stop the further spread by clustering the data using machine learning algorithms and data visualizations. In this way, the rest of the country can participate in economic activities.
4. Helping citizens to find nearest help-centres like free-food areas and Testing Labs etc. For better visualization and show directions. Also alerting them when they are entering any hotspot zone or lockdown area.
